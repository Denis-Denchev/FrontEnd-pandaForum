    <p>## Community Guidelines

Welcome to Alpha Panda Forum — a space for friendly, helpful, and engaging conversations around college life and beyond.

Please follow these community rules:

- Be kind and constructive. Disagreements are fine, but disrespect is not.
- Stay on topic. Post in the correct category and use meaningful titles.
- No bullying, hate speech, or discriminatory content.
- Protect your and others’ privacy. Don’t post personal information.
- Report any harmful or inappropriate content to the moderators.

Our goal is to build a positive community where everyone feels safe to share, learn, and connect.

Let’s grow together, one respectful conversation at a time!
